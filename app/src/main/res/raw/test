"Mad Libs" are short stories that have blanks called placeholders to be filled in.
In the non-computerized version of this game, one person asks a second person to fill in each of the placeholders without the second person knowing the overall story.
Once all placeholders are filled in, the second person is shown the resulting silly story.
Write an Android app that reads in a Mad Lib from a text file in a specific format.
